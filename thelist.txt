Yet another copy of the list follows.

In my opinion the Hunter S Thompson spoken word on Friday was a
waist of $15, I would of done much better by spending the money on
some of his books that I havn't read yet.  It was a question and
answer format.  I thought most of the questions lame, but even though, a
good speaker should of been able to reply with interesting answers.
Hunter S Thompson just wasn't interesting live.  Many people (myself
included) walked out during the show.  I still sugest that you read
his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

The PRIMUS show at the Warfield will be very hot, and it will SELL OUT.
I saw them Saturday night at the Phoenix in Petaluma, they had the sold
out crowd going crazy.  Les said they will play some of the new songs
they been working on at the Warfield.  Also, while I'm typing this 
hopefully my vcr is catching their first video, John The Fisherman
which is to be on MTV's 120 minutes tonight.
