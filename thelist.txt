funk-punk-thrash-ska      Upcoming shows of interest       July  6, 2020

jul  6 mon I think it will probably be at least August or later before
       any of the Bay Area live music venues are allowed to open again.
       The shows below are still shown online as happening but I think many
       venues just haven't been able to update thier online social sites.
