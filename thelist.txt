  Okay, here is my current list for the week of June 25th.  I've included
info on some of the clubs.  The club list is kind of lame for now, I'll
improve it as time goes by.  I've listed the Stone and Omni shows, but I
find them very hard to recommend because of their pay to play, drink
ticket requirements, and no in's and out's policies.
  If anyone has any comments/corrections on the below list please let
me know.
