Okay, below find your weekly installation of The List.
Some notes:  Whipping Boy did not play last Monday at the Edge as I had
previously listed, and Mister Hyde and Siox Nation were on the bill.
Also 24-7 Spyz did not play thursday at the Phoenix Theater in Petaluma,
the Disciples Of Ed ended up heading the bill.  
I am working on getting better information.

Some of the bands I herd last week that I would suggest are:
Siox Nation, Thee Headcoats, Disciples of Ed (lot of bass), The Louies,
and the Warlock Pinchers (hot).  I also saw the movie Disgusteen, a lot
of local bands are on the soundtrack, low budget but worth seeing.

One last note, THANKS to all of you that have been sending me
info, updates, and corrections, it is appreciated.  Thanks.
