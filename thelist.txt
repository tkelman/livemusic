* recommendable shows 
@ pit warning
$ will probably sell out

^ under 21 forced to buy drink tickets
# no ins & outs (once you leave you have to pay to get back in)

All shows at Gilman Street and AMP are recommended
	(all ages, cheap prices, they treat bands decently)
	No advanced tickets sold for Gilman or AMP

Stone and Omni are pay to play (other than headlining bands are
	forced to sell a minimum number of tickets to play, fucked!!)
