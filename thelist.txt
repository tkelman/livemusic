  Below is the List for the week of July 9th, 1990.
  July 13 I would suggest Green Jello and The White Trash Debutantes at
924 Gilman St. or for people in the city Fungo Mungo, Bluchunks,
and Dot 3 at the Stone.
  July 14 catch D.R.I. at the Stone, when that show gets over (about 10:45)
high tail it across town and get to the FREE show at the I-Beam, you should
be able to get their and park in plenty of time to catch headliner Bomb.
Note:  Call to confirm about D.R.I. playing, they may have to cancel.
Another good show on Jul 14 is at 924 Gilman St. with Fungo Mungo, Sprawl,
Pauls' God and others.
  One more note, Primus will be playing the Stone on the 24th, this is
their last show before leaving on a two month tour.  They are also
working on their video (John the Fisherman), which I understand will
have a lot of animation in it.
