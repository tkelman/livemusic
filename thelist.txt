jun 21 thr Bad Religion, No Doubt, Skankin Pickle at AMP
	all ages 9 pm *** @@ $ (be early... or you might not get in) 
	1939 Center St. Berkeley, about a 5 minute walk from downtown Bart
	Note: I missed BR at Gilman, I was one of the hundred+ that couldn't
	      get into the sold out show.  Skankin Pickle I've seen twice,
	      you WILL have a great time at their show, the blend of SKA/THRASH
	      that they played June 17 at their Napa show blew the place away,
	      even the cops that came because of noise complaints were cool 
	      and didn't freak out like cops normally due when they see a pit.
	      I haven't seen No Doubt, but what I've herd of them I would
	      recommend this show even if they were the only band playing.
